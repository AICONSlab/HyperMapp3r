# HyperMapp3r

*HyperMapp3r* (pronounced hypermapper) is a CNN-based segmentation algorithm of White Matter Hyperintensity(WMH) segmentation using MRI images from BrainLab. It can deal with brains with extensive atrophy and segments the wmh in seconds. It uses a T1-weighted, FLAIR, and brain mask images as the inputs and segments.

We recommend using HyperMapp3r with the Docker or Singularity containers we provide, since support for local installs has been discontinued. See our :doc:`installation instructions <./install>` for more information.
